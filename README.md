# ðŸ“š Sergii Velykodnyi's Wiki

It is my personal collection of useful articles, guides, tutorials and tips. It is a knowledge base that I use to store and share information that I find useful.

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/wiki](http://localhost:3000/wiki).

## Deployment

Deployment is powered on GitHub Actions. It runs automatically on push to the `main` branch with changes in `pages` directory or `next.config.js` and `theme.config.jsx` files. Moreover, it can be run manually in the [Actions](https://github.com/sergiivelykodnyi/wiki/actions/workflows/pages.yml) tab.
